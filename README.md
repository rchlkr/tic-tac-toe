# a browser tic-tac-toe game
using modular JS format.

entire gameplay is housed within an immediately invoked function expression, 
only returning variables that are needed to update the player objects and scoreboard. 
any variables not returned are undefined within the global scope. 
the goal was to have as little in the global scope as possible. 

you can play by default as 'Player 1' and 'Player 2,' or click the pencil 
to replace them with custom names.
